# Helping Hands

"Helping Hands" is a web-based full stack
application that comes as a charity program management
approach using the MERN Stack framework. We focus on
collecting and managing valuable data relevant to the charity
activities and aiming to socialize the good humanitarian process.
Admin role is the one who handles the system, and this process
reduces the time consuming and provides a systematic practice.
UI/UX and good practices have been followed to get the best
results from the system for the user. Basically 4 functions are
focused here. They are Donations management, Donors
management, Beneficiaries management and Volunteers
management. Create, read, update, delete and search operations
can be executed for all the four functions. Additionally, all data
can be generated as a final report. All these procedures help to
make the charity program successful and make future decisions.

# INTRODUCTION

Charity is the act of spreading love and kindness to others
unconditionally, which is a cognizant act, but the decision is
made by the heart, without expecting a reward. When Charity
is carried out generously, it is a one-way act where a person
gives but asks for nothing in return. The knowledge that you’re
helping others is enormously empowering and, in turn, can
make you feel happier and more fulfilled.
Charity is indispensable and therefore meant to be achieved for
the public benefit, relief and to aid people at times of need in
any part of the world, especially those who are the victims of
war, natural disaster, catastrophe, inflation, terrorism, hunger,
disease, poverty, orphans by supplying them with food, shelter,
medical aid, and other essential needs.
Such noble purposes can gain momentum from marching the
education of youth for the public progression by making grants
and awards to students in full-time education. When
considering poverty in the developing world, people feel deep
sorrow but seem to put no determination whatsoever to deduct
or eliminate the problem. Poverty in today’s world has turned
out to be sinister and we lay passive towards the problem,
therefore such attitude has made us powerless to stop it.
When everyone is giving to an operative charity, the size of the
donation would directly correspond to the number of people we
are able to help. No need to be a millionaire to make a
noteworthy difference. Just as every drop in the ocean counts to
form a vast water mass, even small donations have the potential
to drastically progress an individual’s quality of life.
Through love, motivation, and opportunities we help people
thrive and become self-sufficient, and on the other hand, there
are organizations to support the elderly with dignity and
assistance. As these organizations have taken up a sacred
mission of helping the helpless, it’s now our duty as well to help
them to raise funds and support their noble cause.
As explained above, progressive citizens of the country have a
responsibility to keep the volunteers, beneficiaries, and the
donors on the loop as they were the ones who making this
noteworthy effort successful. Therefore, “Helping Hands”
charity organization has its own specific user and attribute
management system, which its sole purpose being managing all
the major charity contributors such as volunteers, beneficiaries,
and the donors, as the system administrator throughout the
lifespan of the system.
Usually, many volunteering charity organizations do not follow
up with their track record. Either they don’t have enough preexisting
resources to continue with such a system, or they don’t
care for the hardworking individuals who put their life on the
line for this noble cause. With the help of donors and the vision
of the volunteers of Helping Hands, we have made a gigantic
impact in the lives of the people that is visible with transparency
to our donors and the people interested in the process of saving
lives.
Henceforth, this paper will further materialize on how this
management system works, and how it is advantageous in a
technical way. With user case diagrams, sequence diagram,
system development life cycles, ER Diagrams, and UML
diagrams will explain how functionalities work in respective
ways.
